# microgrid-monitoring-dashboard
A web application for remotely monitoring relatively simple electrical grids. Built using React.js and the material-ui react library.
The backend is firebase; firebase auth, firebase real time database and firebase cloud functions to accept voltage and current values from the arduino boards connected to the grid.

This particular micro grid case study was for a hospital in Kanungu which is a district in a remote part of Uganda
